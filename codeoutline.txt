(A very brief exaplation of how these system will probably be implemented)

    Areas in the game will be structured in an "object" (the type of object depends on which langauge I use) this will be the 2nd most outer layer called zones.
    Each of the zone will be connected in defferent ways. Each of these zones will be a grid that will contain a 2d array of an objects called square. each of 
    these square objects will hold information such as who is on the square(be it player or npc), the environment of the square, any loot that is on the square,
    and enterences to places. each of the places will use the zone object just on a smaller scale and maybe not using some of the atributes. when 2 or more characters
    are on one square they can interact with each other. Each characterr will be repersented as an object that contains key information about their character such
    as their stats, their spells/attacks, the equipment they are wearing, the loot they are carring.

(! Means in progress !! Means done)

(Things that I need to research)

    Client/server model that makes sense
    How to implement SDL 2 into the client
    Most data such as items, character information, ect. Will be stored in an SQL database. I will need to research how to interact with a sql database via C
    This will need to be multiple file so I need to learn how make works


(Bullet point list of what I need to do (not exhaustive yet))
    SQL server
        create a database
        create tables with in the database
        populate the tables

    Server
        Communicate with client!!
            use possix send/recv!!
        Create world structure!
        Create zone structure!
        Create square structure!
        Create character structure!
        Create item structure!
        Create class structure!
        Create combat function


    
    Client
        Communicate with server!!
            use possix send/recv!!
